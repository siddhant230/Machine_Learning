Simple implementation of Gaussian Mixture Model; with visualization and placeholders.
GMM in general are simple soft-clustering algorithm that uses Expectation-Maximization algorithm for optimization.
Instead of hard-assignment of each data-point to a certain class; in GMM; 
data points are weighed according to class probability and then sampled with respect to parameters for each gaussian; which provides soft-assignment.
